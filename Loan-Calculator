# Loan Calculator based on Python3

## Brief description

This program would get 3 information such as:
    -Loan amount
    -Annual interest rate in percent
    -Loan Duration in years
and would return below items:
    1-Loan amount and Interest rate
    2-Duration and monthly payments
    3-and showing left amount of loan and total payments in seprated loan duration years.

## Instruction

This program developed in 2 majules and main program.
One of the functions is going to calculate payments, the other one calculate remaining balance, and main program would get data from user and return result of calculations.

### Majule One - Calculating Payment

def payment_mine (principal, annual_interest_rate, duration):
    r=float((annual_interest_rate/100)/12)   #calculate monthly interest rate
    n=duration*12   #change yearly duration to monthly
    if annual_interest_rate != 0:
        MonthlyPayment= float((principal *r*(1+r)**n)/((1+r)**n-1))

    else:
        MonthlyPayment= float(principal/n)

    return MonthlyPayment

### Majule Two - Calculating Remaining Balance

def remaining_loan (principal, annual_interest_rate, duration, number_of_payments):
    r=float((annual_interest_rate/100)/12)   #calculate monthly interest rate
    n=duration*12   #change yearly duration to monthly
    p=number_of_payments

    #Calculations
    if annual_interest_rate != 0:
        RemainingLoanBalance= (principal*((1+r)**n-(1+r)**p))/((1+r)**n-1)
    else:
        RemainingLoanBalance= principal-(principal*p)/n

    return RemainingLoanBalance   

### Main Program

principal=float(input("Enter loan amount: "))
annual_interest_rate=float(input("Enter annual interest rate (percent): "))
duration=int(input("Enter loan duration in years: "))

print("LOAN AMOUNT:", int(principal),"INTEREST RATE (PERCENT):", int(annual_interest_rate))
print("DURATION (YEARS):", int(duration),"MONTHLY PAYMENT:", int(payment_mine(principal, annual_interest_rate, duration)))

#show remaining loan for each year seprately
for item in range(1, duration+1):
    print("YEAR:", item,"BALANCE:", int(remaining_loan(principal, annual_interest_rate, duration, item*12)),"TOTAL PAYMENT",int(payment_mine(principal,annual_interest_rate, duration)*12*item))

## Result Sample

By entering below informations:
    Enter loan amount: 1000.0
    Enter annual interest rate (percent): 10.0
    Enter loan duration in years: 5
Result would be:
    LOAN AMOUNT: 1000 INTEREST RATE (PERCENT): 10
    DURATION (YEARS): 5 MONTHLY PAYMENT: 21
    YEAR: 1 BALANCE: 837 TOTAL PAYMENT 254
    YEAR: 2 BALANCE: 658 TOTAL PAYMENT 509
    YEAR: 3 BALANCE: 460 TOTAL PAYMENT 764
    YEAR: 4 BALANCE: 241 TOTAL PAYMENT 1019
    YEAR: 5 BALANCE: 0 TOTAL PAYMENT 1274
