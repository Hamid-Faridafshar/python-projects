### python-projects
This repository had been created in case of sharing my own python programs. <br> I think these projects would be helpful of your daily use and i would get happy while I see your great comments on my algorithms. <br>
I tried to code suffient in both memory and time processing but your great comments cause recheck and updating my code.

#### Instruction
To whom do not have enough knowledge of python, i will do my best to share it's GUI platform beside the codes. <br>
GUI files would be found with "\*_gui" name structure. ( \* is basename of the project ) <br>
Projects that have more than one file, would categorized in directories. <br>
Codes may recieve updates
